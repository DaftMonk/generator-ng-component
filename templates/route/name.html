<div>This is the <%= name %> view.
  <p>This comes from the backend {{ vm.service.<%= name %>FromBackend }}</p>
  <p>Use "one time binding" like this: {{ :vm.someThing }}.
      After the first update the $watch will be removed from the variable,
      so it won't cost more resources to check it's value every digest cycle (performance).
  </p>
</div>
